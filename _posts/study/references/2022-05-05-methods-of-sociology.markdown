#### The Comparative Method

The comparative method refers to *"the method of comparing different societies or groups within the same society to show whether and why they are similar or different in certain respects."* By comparing of differences across societies or groups within the same society, one can find clues in order to understand the societies in a better manner. This method isn't exclusive only to sociology rather it is an universal one since it is based upon reasoning. There are various Sociologists who has used this method in their work and thus made it popular in the 19<sup>th</sup> century. For example,

**Durkeheim**: He has explained the comparative method on three different occasions which are as follows:[^1]

- In his "The Rules of Sociological Method", he opined that the sociological explanation consists entirly in the establishment of casual connections. It is different from establishing casual connections in natural sciences since in the case of natural science, the casual connections could be more easily established due to facility of experiment while that is not applicable in social science. Since such direct methods are not applicable, one has to resort to indirect methods such as comparative method.  
- In his work, "Division of Labor in Society", he compared the legal systems of different societies at the same time and their different levels of devlopment. He proposed the hypothesis that **increase in the division of labor is accompanied by a change in social integration.**
- Further, in his study, "Suicide", he showed that the suicide rate varied inversely with the degree of social cohesion and with the degree of stability of moral norms.
