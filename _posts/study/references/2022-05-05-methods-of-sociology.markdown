#### The Comparative Method

The comparative method refers to *"the method of comparing different societies or groups within the same society to show whether and why they are similar or different in certain respects."* By comparing of differences across societies or groups within the same society, one can find clues in order to understand the societies in a better manner. This method isn't exclusive only to sociology rather it is an universal one since it is based upon reasoning. There are various Sociologists who has used this method in their work and thus made it popular in the 19<sup>th</sup> century. For example,

**Durkeheim**: In his "The Rules of Sociological Method", he opined that the sociological explanation consists entirly in the establishment of casual connections. It is different from establishing casual connections in natural sciences since in the case of natural science, the casual connections could be more easily established due to facility of experiment while that is not applicable in social science. Since such direct methods are not applicable, one has to resort to indirect methods such as comparative method.
