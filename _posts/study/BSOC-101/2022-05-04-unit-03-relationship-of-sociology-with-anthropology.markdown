**Nature of Sociology and Social anthropology**

The term *sociology* was coined by [Auguste Comte](/study/reference/people/auguste-comte) in 1838. This word is derived from Latin words 'Socius' (companion or associate) and 'logos' (knowledge). In simple terms, it can be defined as **Scientific study of human society which tries to explain the contexts of social phenomena.** Sociology also emphasizes more on the side of collective aspects of human behavior. Hence many different subjects overlap each other in their field of study such as *anthropology, political science, economics, psychology, geography, education etc.* 

In terms of closeness to discipline of Sociology, the social/cultural anthropology has been one of the closest academic subjects. There used to be some conventions (not applicable in mordern acadmic discourses) which are as follows:

| Anthropology                    | Sociology                 |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Deals with pre-literate society | Deals with modern society |
| Studies micro subjects          | Studies macro subjects    |
|                                 |                           |
