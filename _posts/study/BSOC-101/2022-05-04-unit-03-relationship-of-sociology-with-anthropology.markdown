#### Nature of Sociology and Social anthropology

The term *sociology* was coined by [Auguste Comte](/study/reference/people/auguste-comte) in 1838 in his book [*Positive Phiolosophy*](https://app.treasure.cloud/share/public/b6356ccc97b9d1a4724b019b8916ea6df564ef29b458dc876c63e6efdfe2cd34). This word is derived from Latin words 'Socius' (companion or associate) and 'logos' (knowledge). In simple terms, it can be defined as **Scientific study of human society which tries to explain the contexts of social phenomena.** Sociology also emphasizes more on the side of collective aspects of human behavior. Hence many different subjects overlap each other in their field of study such as *anthropology, political science, economics, psychology, geography, education etc.* 

In terms of closeness to discipline of Sociology, the social/cultural anthropology has been one of the closest academic subjects. There used to be some conventions (not applicable in mordern acadmic discourses) which are as follows:

| Anthropology                    | Sociology                 |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Deals with pre-literate society | Deals with modern society |
| Studies micro subjects          | Studies macro subjects    |
|                                 |                           |

However these differences are not true anymore since, the demarcation between them is getting thinner and thinner. 

#### Emergence and history of sociology

Sociology as an academic discourse has relatively short history of development. Although, the study of society was occuring centuries after centuries, sociology as a subject came to exist only in 19<sup>th</sup> century. In anceint times, *[Socreates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socrates), [Plato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato), [Aristotole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle), [Cicero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicero)* has provided immense contribution towards understanding of human society. This was the first time when scholars try to understand human society in a systematic manner. In the medieval age i.e. 16<sup>th</sup> century A.D., *[Thomas Hobbes](/study/reference/people/thomas-hobbes.html)* and also *[Machiavelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niccol%C3%B2_Machiavelli)* made impatcful contribution to understand the relationship between Society and the State. In Europe by 18<sup>th</sup> century, many scholars were born such as *Rousseau, Vico and Baron de Montesquieu* who studied various social phenomena of their times. These earlier works by various scholars have led to the foundation of social science which includes both sociology and anthropology. Among the contributional factors for the emergence of Social sciences, the most siginificant one is **the socio-political changes that were taking place in Europe in 18<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> century which includes industrial revolution and French revolution.**
