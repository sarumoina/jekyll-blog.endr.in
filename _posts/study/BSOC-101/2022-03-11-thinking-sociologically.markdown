title: 'Unit 01: Thinking Sociologically'
---

#### Objectives

- what is meant as a sociological perspective

- How do sociologists observe and interpret the realities of everyday life

#### Opinions from various scholars:

- **Zygmunt Bauman**: power as the key driver of social relationships. Power refers to status and role and society based upon values created and maintained by those who have power and the resources to propagate the values. The power hierarchies will define the meanings acquired by objects and things. 

- **C. W. Mills**: (Limited to American Society). He shows how values and history shape our views. Each society has its own way of thinking as collective but it can also change under impact of sudden social changes. What people imagine to be or themselves as its members, is shaped through a long historical process that creates certain kinds of values and then those values gets embedded in the system. 

In short, **Bauman** emphasizes role played by power while **Mills** look towards a historical shaping of cognition. 

## Sociological methods:

Mills (1959) concept of “**abstracted empiricism**[^1]” posits that **empirical studies**[^2] mostly follow a set pattern of collecting data with conventional styles of collecting them, which then are codified[^3]. 

> **Limitation of this process:** 
>
> most studies involving the collection and analysis of public opinion, look into the aspect of how public opinion are mapped and collected as data, but **they ignore the process of getting the data or the process by which public opinion is formed.**

**Mills** work may hold true only for US and western countries. What is important is that in the abstracted empirical style, what is needed to be studied has not been given consideration, and the emphasis has been on method rather than content of study and also its relevance for being studied.

The [**Abstracted empiricist**](/study/reference/abstract-empiricism) is more concerned with the philosophy of science, the Scientific Method, rather than what he studies is all about. 

**Paul F. Lazersfeld** has explained how abstracted empiricism can be used as a style of work and regards the “**sociologist as the methodologist of all social sciences**”. Thus empiricism becomes the hallmark of sociology as compared to philosophy or epistemology. Rather than thinking about why things happen, sociologists try to focus on what is happening and how it is happening.

_Mills opposition to abstracted empiricism was based on its preoccupation with method and its consequent lack of substantive propositions and theories. Abstracted empiricists, according to Mills, project themselves as scientists, and their approach as akin to the scientific procedures of natural science. This lead to the fetishism of method, an obsession with ‘reliability’, and more concern with the philosophy of science than with the social research study itself._ [source](https://www.qualityresearchinternational.com/socialresearch/abstractedempiricism.htm)

_Footnotes:_

[^1]: In philosophy, empiricism is a theory that states that knowledge comes only or primarily from sensory experience. In other words, the theory that all knowledge is based on experience derived from the senses. 

[^2]: It is a way of gaining knowledge by means of direct and indirect observation or experience. Empirical evidence (the record of one's direct observations or experiences) can be analyzed quantitatively or qualitatively. Quantifying the evidence or making sense of it in qualitative form, a researcher can answer empirical questions, which should be clearly defined and answerable with the evidence collected (usually called data). 

[^3]: Codifying social practices amounts to embarking on a process of transforming practical knowledge—knowing in action—into a message that can be processed as information
