title: 'Unit 01: Thinking Sociologically'
---

## Objectives

- what is meant as a sociological perspective

- How do sociologists observe and interpret the realities of everyday life

## Opinions from various scholars:

- **Zygmunt Bauman**: power as the key driver of social relationships. Power refers to status and role and society based upon values created and maintained by those who have power and the resources to propagate the values. The power hierarchies will define the meanings acquired by objects and things. 

- **C. W. Mills**: (Limited to American Society). He shows how values and history shape our views. Each society has its own way of thinking as collective but it can also change under impact of sudden social changes. What people imagine to be or themselves as its members, is shaped through a long historical process that creates certain kinds of values and then those values gets embedded in the system. 

In short, **Bauman** emphasizes role played by power while **Mills** look towards a historical shaping of cognition.
