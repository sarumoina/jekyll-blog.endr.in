## Objectives

- what is meant as a sociological perspective

- How do sociologists observe and interpret the realities of everyday life

## Opinions from various scholars:

- **Zygmunt Bauman**: power as the key driver of social relationships.

The power hierarchies will define the meanings acquired by objects and things.
