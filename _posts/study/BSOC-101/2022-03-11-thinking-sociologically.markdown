title: 'Unit 01: Thinking Sociologically'
---

#### Objectives

- what is meant as a sociological perspective

- How do sociologists observe and interpret the realities of everyday life

#### Opinions from various scholars:

- **Zygmunt Bauman**: power as the key driver of social relationships. Power refers to status and role and society based upon values created and maintained by those who have power and the resources to propagate the values. The power hierarchies will define the meanings acquired by objects and things. 

- **C. W. Mills**: (Limited to American Society). He shows how values and history shape our views. Each society has its own way of thinking as collective but it can also change under impact of sudden social changes. What people imagine to be or themselves as its members, is shaped through a long historical process that creates certain kinds of values and then those values gets embedded in the system. 

In short, **Bauman** emphasizes role played by power while **Mills** look towards a historical shaping of cognition. 

## Sociological methods:

Mills (1959) concept of “abstracted empiricism[^1]” posits that empirical studies[^2] mostly follow a set pattern of collecting data with conventional styles of collecting them, which then are codified[^3].

[^1]: In philosophy, empiricism is a theory that states that knowledge comes only or primarily from sensory experience. In other words, the theory that all knowledge is based on experience derived from the senses. 

[^2]: It is a way of gaining knowledge by means of direct and indirect observation or experience. Empirical evidence (the record of one's direct observations or experiences) can be analyzed quantitatively or qualitatively. Quantifying the evidence or making sense of it in qualitative form, a researcher can answer empirical questions, which should be clearly defined and answerable with the evidence collected (usually called data). 

[^3]: Codifying social practices amounts to embarking on a process of transforming practical knowledge—knowing in action—into a message that can be processed as information
