#### Objectives

- what is meant as a sociological perspective

- How do sociologists observe and interpret the realities of everyday life

#### Opinions from various scholars:

- **Zygmunt Bauman**: power as the key driver of social relationships. Power refers to status and role and society based upon values created and maintained by those who have power and the resources to propagate the values. The power hierarchies will define the meanings acquired by objects and things. 

- **C. W. Mills**: (Limited to American Society). He shows how values and history shape our views. Each society has its own way of thinking as collective but it can also change under impact of sudden social changes. What people imagine to be or themselves as its members, is shaped through a long historical process that creates certain kinds of values and then those values gets embedded in the system. 

In short, **Bauman** emphasizes role played by power while **Mills** look towards a historical shaping of cognition. 

#### Sociological methods:

Mills (1959) concept of “**abstracted empiricism**[^1]” posits that **empirical studies**[^2] mostly follow a set pattern of collecting data with conventional styles of collecting them, which then are codified[^3]. 

> **Limitation of this process:** 
>
> most studies involving the collection and analysis of public opinion, look into the aspect of how public opinion are mapped and collected as data, but **they ignore the process of getting the data or the process by which public opinion is formed.**

**Mills** work may hold true only for US and western countries. What is important is that in the abstracted empirical style, what is needed to be studied has not been given consideration, and the emphasis has been on method rather than content of study and also its relevance for being studied.

The [**Abstracted empiricist**](/study/reference/abstract-empiricism) is more concerned with the philosophy of science, the Scientific Method, rather than what he studies is all about. 

**Paul F. Lazersfeld** has explained how abstracted empiricism can be used as a style of work and regards the “**sociologist as the methodologist of all social sciences**”. Thus empiricism becomes the hallmark of sociology as compared to philosophy or epistemology. Rather than thinking about why things happen, sociologists try to focus on what is happening and how it is happening.

_Mills opposition to abstracted empiricism was based on its preoccupation with method and its consequent lack of substantive propositions and theories. Abstracted empiricists, according to Mills, project themselves as scientists, and their approach as akin to the scientific procedures of natural science. This lead to the fetishism of method, an obsession with ‘reliability’, and more concern with the philosophy of science than with the social research study itself._ [source](https://www.qualityresearchinternational.com/socialresearch/abstractedempiricism.htm)

#### Sociology in everyday life:

Mills’ (1959) concept of “[**The Promise**](/study/reference/the-promise-mills)” relates to the **trap** that people find themselves unable to get rid-off life circumstances. People are caught in the vicious circle of mundane ordinary everyday living which are affected by circumstances beyond their control but which they fail to comprehend.

To illustrate Mills’s viewpoint, let’s use our sociological imaginations to understand some important contemporary social problems. We will start with unemployment, which Mills himself discussed. If only a few people were unemployed, Mills wrote, we could reasonably explain their unemployment by saying they were lazy, lacked good work habits, and so forth. If so, their unemployment would be their own personal trouble. But when millions of people are out of work, unemployment is best understood as a public issue because, as Mills (1959, p. 9)Mills, C. W. (1959). The sociological imagination. London, England: Oxford University Press. put it, “the very structure of opportunities has collapsed. Both the correct statement of the problem and the range of possible solutions require us to consider the economic and political institutions of the society, and not merely the personal situation and character of a scatter of individuals.” [**explained in detail here**](/study/reference/the-promise-mills)

>**Trap**: is referring to the social changes that occur which affect the ordinary man — certain external influences which transcend the internal human spaces, and both are inter-related. But people are unable to decipher that happenings in the world outside have a direct effect on the everyday and make them what they are.

Thus human agency is limited by where we are born and what happens outside of our immediate social context. Thus the sociological imagination is constructed out of historical circumstances and values that are received. When people come in touch with other societies their ability or willingness is conditioned by information received and not actual circumstances. **Thus reason is often overridden by values in the sociology of everyday life.**

#### Comparative method:

The comparative method is where the researcher collects data about different social groups (eg working-class; middle-class and upper-class) and then compares one group with another to identify what is evident in one group but not another. [source](https://sociologytwynham.com/2015/01/05/the-comparative-method/)

The _analyst_ can see the link between **history** and the **individual**. They enable the individual to understand his/her experiences in that particular period and calculate their chances in life by looking at other individual in similar circumstances. The special ability of the sociologists is to connect the personal to the larger context both historically and in the present circumstances.


#### Sociological Concepts:

- **Group:** Individuals can not function as an isolated system as they are born in one and it is is the group that gives identity/meaning of existence to that person. But on the downside, groups often restrains an individual on some other aspects. Hence, social groups can act both as enabler and constrainer at the same time. It is social knowledge that we gathered from the group ultimately contributes to the forming of values.

[^2]: It is a way of gaining knowledge by means of direct and indirect observation or experience. Empirical evidence (the record of one's direct observations or experiences) can be analyzed quantitatively or qualitatively. Quantifying the evidence or making sense of it in qualitative form, a researcher can answer empirical questions, which should be clearly defined and answerable with the evidence collected (usually called data).
