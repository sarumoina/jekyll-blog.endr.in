#### Section A:

**Discuss Sapir-Whorf hypothesis. Do you agree with this theory? Give reasons for your answer. (300 words)**

The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis is the linguistic theory that the semantic structure of a language shapes or limits the ways in which the speaker 	forms conception of the world. This theory came to be known during the year 1929. This theory is named after the American anthropological linguist Edward Sapir (1884-1939) and his student Benjamin – Whorf (1897-1941). This theory is also known with various other names such as theory of linguistic relativity, linguistic relativism, linguistic determinism, Whorfian hypothesis, Whorfianism etc. The idea that a person’s native language determines how he or she thinks was popular among the behaviorist thinkers in the 1930s until cognitive psychology came into play. Behaviorism suggests that the behavior of a person is a result of external conditioning and does not take feelings, emotions into account.) The Sapir – Whorf hypothesis was popular but as the 90s came, the flaw in the theory made it irrelevant. 
The biggest flaw in the Sapir – Whorf hypothesis is that, if a person’s language has no words for a particular concept, then that person won’t understand the concept which as it is evident is untrue. Later, it was realized that language doesn’t necessarily control a human's ability to reason or have an emotional response or understand something. It’s also ambiguous to ascertain that if two different persons speaking two different languages think differently, then it is language which is shaping the thoughts of the two persons in different ways since there are other variables such as external factors which may affect the person in a greater way. Moreover, even if there were no appropriate words with respect to any concept, that does not necessarily mean that that person can’t understand the concept. Rather, it has been seen that it's the thought process which propels someone from understanding rather than whether the language has the appropriate word or not. These weaknesses have rendered the hypothesis obsolete in later stages. 


**Define onomatopoeia. Give examples to explain the concept. (300 words)**

Also called as “figure of sound”, Onomatopoeia is the use of words that imitate sounds associated with the objects or any actions they refer to. There are various examples of Onomatopoeia which are found in different languages. For example, in English, people use hiss or murmur in different contexts which are perfect examples of onomatopoeia which refers to the words that imitate sound that are associated with the objects or actions that are referred to. But Onomatopoeia doesn’t restrict itself to the sounds that are associated to the actions or the object but it can also refer to the made - up sounds such as writing “zzzzzz….” In the context of sleeping action. Hence, it can be said that onomatopoeia exists throughout different languages in human society even though the respective sounds for the same action can vary among them. 
If divulged into the subject further, one can see that there are different types of onomatopoeia. E.g. 
Real word that sounds like real things: These are the conventional onomatopoeia which uses words that evokes the sound of the real thing. For example, the word “meow”. 
Real words that are made to evoke the sound of real things: This is rather a rare type of onomatopoeia in which a word or a series of words is used to mimic a real-world sound even though the words don't sound like the real thing.  
Made – up words that sounds like real things: There may instances where one may need to make up wounds so that he/she can mimic the sound of the real thing. For example, in order to mimic knocking of a door, “taatarrattaat” is used in many occasions. 
A series of letters that mimic a raw sound: Sometimes a series of words or letters may become representative of an action in literature. For example, “zzzzz…..” signifies that one may be asleep. 

**What is a signifier? Give examples from your mother tongue to support your explanation. (300 words)**

Signifier can be simply defined as an entity that represents the affordances that can be done with the entity. There are various examples of signifiers that we often use in our day to day lives. For example, the word “push” can be used in many different ways in order to accomplish different objectives. Often doors have the word “push” written on it which implies its affordance of moving when pushed. But in the devices, we often use symbols instead of writing the word though it successfully conveys the message to the user. 
As time progresses, there are many symbols that are exposed to our day to day lives that don't even require words written on them. For example, in multimedia controls, the right-angle triangle implies play or pause. If someone is writing in word processing software, the diskette icon implies saving the file. Or one may not know the name of the symbol that represents the settings in mobile but just looking at it, one knows how to look for it. Thus, signifiers allow us to convey messages without the requirement of having to write the words. 
All signs have a signifier and signified component. The signifier is the material form of the sign. This is the element that can be touched, heard, taste, touch etc. If we expand this logic, then it can be also stated that, the words we speak and write can also be considered as signifiers since similar to signs that have been mentioned above, the words also represent various objects or phenomena. Thus, the words can also act as a signifier in the context that it can also act as a sign in order to point towards a real thing. 

**What are some of the Saussurean principles? Briefly explain them. (300 words)**

Saussure was a Swiss linguist who laid the great foundation in linguistics in the 20th century. He gave many lectures at the University of Geneva around 1901 to 1906 which showed the research, ideas, analysis of the languages that could give us a great insight into the world of structural linguistics. In order to make linguistics more understandable, Sassure had come up with various principles or theories which also gave a glimpse of the history of structural linguistics. 
Langue and Parole: The language consists of two parts out of which one part is called langue and other part is called parole. Linguistic communication is possible only when these two components work together since if they work independently and individually, then linguistic communication is not possible. 
Langue represents the system of language having signs, patterns devised by a group for communication. 
Parole refers to the utterance of the langue. Hence, it varies from one community to another and also it varies across different regions. 
Paradigm and Syntagm: The relation between the words corresponding to the operation of our brains. Syntagmatic relation is when the words either spoken or written have different grammatical roles in the sentence. On the contrary, a paradigmatic relation is when these two words can substitute each other in a sentence. 
Synchrony and Diachrony: Synchrony studies the language existing in a particular period of time while the diachronic study is concerned with its historic development. 
Arbitrariness of the Sign: Signs are the basic elements of linguistic communication. Sassure believed that signs are understood best on the basis of what is signified and what is signifies. He suggested that a word in any language is given the meaning through the functioning of signs which forms the relationship between the signifier and signified. According to him, this relationship does not follow any pattern and it is purely arbitrary. 

**Why is word stress significant in English? Give examples to support your answer. (300 words)**

Stress has many significance in any language. Especially in English, stress plays a very important role. Since English is not a flat language, hence it’s the stress which gives different directions in many instances in different contexts. The role of stress in the English language can be realized when words in English are broken down into syllables. For example dog, car, box etc. have only one syllable in them and hence has only one sound. But when there is more than one syllable, then stress comes into play. For example, words like pretty [pret-ty], export [ex-port] etc have two syllables. There are other words in English which have more than two syllables such as important [im-por-tant], realistic [real-is-tic] where stresses are put in different syllables. Taking the example of important, the stress is put into the “por” syllable and hence important is pronounced not as flat but as imPORtant. Though multiple syllables can be present in a word, some syllables are pronounced with more stress and hence they are taken as strong syllables while the other syllables which are pronounced without any stress are called as weak syllables. 
Word stress heavily affects the sounds of a vowel of a word and putting stress on different syllables can alter the meanings of a word in a context. Thus incorrect words stress can create miscommunication between different people. It is especially true for non native speakers of English where their mother tongue does not have much importance on stress in the language. For example, Mandarin has little stress on the words so pronunciation stays the same for more or less for most people but since in case of English, stress plays a crucial part, one has to pay attention. 

**How can we use multilingualism as a resource? (300 words)**

Multilingualism is the application of more than one language by an individual or a group of people which also represent multiculturalism in certain contexts. The aspect of multilingualism differs from country to country and that too from one society to another. Hence, Multilingualism as a resource and its effects won’t be the same in two different regions. In English speaking countries such as the US or UK, every student must learn the subjects in english and hence, whether it is native english speaking students or coming from abroad, everyone must communicate via english since all the curriculum will be based upon only one language in most cases. However, that does not remain the same in case of India where from one state to another, the mother tongue may vary and students will have the opportunity to learn in different mediums. In an Indian multilingual classroom, the majority of the children will have one language in common which will be spoken and understood by most. Their first language will have lots of similarity with the majority of the students and hence it creates a cultural bond between these students. This process is rather unconscious since one does not consciously choose to assimilate based upon spoken language rather it’s the similarities that subconsciously bonds these students. Unlike the monolingual countries such as the US but in India, students can study in english however while speaking, they can use different local languages to convey their emotions. Children growing up in a multilingualism environment naturally learn different languages in order to communicate with different people and in the process, they learn about different traditions, culture etc. In a similar way, a teacher in the classroom of a multilingualism environment can use different creative skills to teach students in different languages. 

#### Section B:

**Citing examples, explain how can we compare words? What are the different relationships that exist between words? (300 words)**

There are different ways one can use in order to compare words. But among them, the most commonly used one is comparative form. If there are more words to compare, then the superlative form is used. 
Comparative form: Following sentences use the comparative form in order to explain the scenarios. 
Employment issues are more important than political problems at this point of time. Job training is more critical to sustain well being than food stamps and other welfare programs. Politicians are more worried about elections than the condition of the economy. 
One can also use “as….as” in order to compare between different words though it is slightly different from the above for the fact that it is a form to show something as equa. For example, The loss of manufacturing jobs is as unfortunate as the drop in pay. Spending on education is the same cost as other countries in the world. It isn’t as easy as one might think. 
In all the above cases, comparison is made though both qualities are same.  
In other cases, when comparisons are made in multiple words, then superlative form is used. For example, 
Dedication is the most important factor to get success in any work field. 
Conjunction and connectors: In order to show contrast, conjunction and connectors are used. For example, Although the initial cost is very high, we will eventually make profit in the longer term. 
However…. nonetheless: We need progress by establishing more industries. However, the aspect of nature must be taken into account. 
Despite… in spite of: Despite the difficulty of the subjects, I believe the students will be able to grasp it. 
The situation will improve in spite of a hard economy. 
Here word comparisons are used in order to compare between multiple different circumstances. 


**Define morpheme. What are the different types of morphemes? (300 words)**

In the subject of morpheme, it can be defined as the smallest meaningful lexical item in a language. But that does not mean that a morpheme must be a word in order to get recognized as the smallest meaningful lexical item in a language. There are subtle differences between a word and a morpheme which does give them a distinguished identity. The difference between a word and a morpheme is that a morpheme may not stand alone in many instances whereas a word is sufficient to stand alone on its own. The field that studies morpheme is called morphology. 
In every entity, it is built up of smaller functional units. For example, in the case of elements of the periodic table, the elements are made up of atoms which themselves consist of electrons, protons and neutrons. Similarly, scholars studying structures of a language also devised a way to recognize the building up of lexical terms of which, the morphemes are the smallest unit. It hence functions as the foundation of the language and the base of the syntax according to which the language grows on. Here syntax refers to the structure or arrangement of words that is defined in a language base upon which various words and sentences are joined together. Though it may feel similar, one shouldn’t confuse morphemes with words since they are both different in terms of lexical structure. 
In linguistics, the morphemes are further classified into two types which are:
 -	Phonemes - the smallest units of grammar recognizable by sound. 
 -	Graphemes - the smallest unit of written language. 
For example, the word “non perishable” consists of three morphemes: non, perish and able. It also has 5 syllables which does imply that morphemes are different from syllables.  Both non and able are examples of an affix, a morpheme attached prior to or following a base that can not function independently as a word. 

**What is derivational morphology? Give two examples of derivation from your mother tongue. (300 words)**

Derivational morphology can be defined as the process where one word is changed into another. The process takes one word and then adds a prefix, suffix or infix to make a new word. For example, if we take the example of “national”, then adding a prefix or suffix will give us the following words: international and nationality.  The words that we have added here are called morphemes. Hence, the process itself is called derivational morphology where in the process, one word is changed into another one. There are many common morphemes which we use in day to day life conversation. For example, morphemes are used to convert nouns/adjectives/verbs into one another. There are different derivational morphology combinations which are used to convert nouns or verbs or even adjectives in others. Thus derivational morphology and morphemes play a crucial role in the English language. Due to the role that is played by morphemes in derivational morphology, it is possible to word from one class (such as noun or verb or adjective) into another by the use of suffixes or prefixes or infix of morphemes. For example, with the use of morphemes, “red” can be turned into “reddish”. The process of conversion of a verb or adjective into a noun is called “nominalization.” The process of nominalization is one of the key factors of the process of derivational morphology. Taking the example of “national” again, the adjective “national” can become the verb “nationality.” And then it can also be converted to “nationalization” which is a noun.  In these conversion; the suffixes or prefixes or infixes are playing a very important role. Thus morphemes are used greatly in such conversion of one word from one class to another and the whole process is known as derivational morphology. 

**Define noun phrase and discuss its structure giving examples. (300 words)**

A noun phrase can be defined as a phrase that has a noun as its head or performs the same grammatical function as noun. An indefinite pronoun can also take the place of the noun as the head of the phrase. The noun phrase is also called a nominal phrase. Noun phrases are very common cross - linguistically and they are probably the most frequently occuring phrase type. As it has been mentioned above, a noun phrase performs the same grammatical function as a noun. A noun phrase also contains modifiers which can come before or after the noun. It is also worth mentioning that a pronoun can also perform the function of the noun as the head. For example, the dog with fleas. The one with fleas. 
In case of noun phrases, it needs to be mentioned that it is rare to find a noun functioning by itself. Most of the time, one will find nouns functioning in noun phrases. There are various examples one may take which can show the use of nouns in noun phrases with modifiers. For example, the soldier, my cousin, with the big nose. Like any noun, a noun phrase can function as a subject or object or as a complement within a sentence. For example, “singing in the bath relaxes me.” (here, the noun phrase is the subject of the verb relaxes) “I know the back streets”.  (here the noun phrase is the direct object of the verb know.)
The noun phrases can get more complicated depending upon the context. It’s not unusual for nouns and noun phrases to be embedded in the noun phrases. For example, in the sentence, “Every man of courage is a man of his word.”; here the courage and word both are nouns but they are not the head nouns of the phrases. 
What are prefixes and suffixes? Separate the prefixes and suffixes in the following words: 

 -	Antiestablishmentarianism - Prefix: Anti, Suffix: ism
 -	Prenatal - Prefix: Pre, Suffix: al
 -	Institutionalisation - _, Suffix: isation
 -	Organisational - Prefix: _, Suffix: al

**Differentiate compound and complex sentences. How are they created ? (300 words)**

There are various structures via which sentences can be formed in the English language. Out of these, compound and complex sentences form an integral part. 
Compound sentences are those sentences in which two independent clauses are combined with coordinating conjunction. The coordinating conjunctions are words for example, “and'' or “but” which are used to combine the individual clauses. “I have a pet dog. His name is Jimmy.'' These are two individual sentences which can stand on their own without depending upon any other sentence to convey the meaning. These two sentences can be combined with coordinating conjunction e.g. “and'' and form a unified sentence such as “I have a pet dog and its name is Jimmy.” Thus forming a compound sentence. All of the clauses in the compound sentence are equally important, and coordinating conjunction does nothing to the importance of the clauses thus keeping the rank of both the sentences are the same. The purpose of coordinating conjunction is simply to combine the sentences. 
Complex sentences differ from compound sentences in the aspect that complex sentences are formed from one independent clause and subordinate clause. Thus, the sentences in complex sentences are not equal in structure since one sentence could express its meaning without depending upon other sentences while the subordinate clause is dependent upon other sentences in order to express its meaning. For example, “my mom smiled when I made the dinner.” In this sentence, the independent statement is, “my mom smiled” and the subordinate clause is, “when I made the dinner.” It is evident from the example that the subordinate clause can not be expressed without depending upon the other sentence. 
Thus, in compound sentences, the two combined sentences are independent and they can express on their own without any dependency. But complex sentences differ from the compound sentences in the aspect that, though the independent sentence can express the meaning on its own but the subordinate clause is not dependent and it relies on the independent  



#### Section C:

**How is human language different from animal communication? (500 words)**

The difference between human language and animal communication lies in the fact that, while animal communication is biological and inborn, human communication revolves around acquired knowledge, words, phrases which are not inborn but are taught. There are many different aspects in which differences between human language and animal communication can be seen. 
Duality patterning: Human language consists of distinctive sounds also known as phonemes which are arbitrary in nature and don't carry any meaning on their own but humans combine them in different ways and create meaningful words which are also understood by others and thus paving the way to communicate with each other. But animals do not have such distinctive sounds and no concept of words which limits the message that they can convey. 
Creativity: Creativity is another aspect which differentiates human communication and animal communication. Humans, due to the evolved brain, can create new words and hence can discover new ways of communication while in the animal kingdom, the species must evolve which will change the sign they use which itself is a very long process. 
Displacement: Humans can talk about remote, abstract things which does not require the elements to be near the vicinity hence the subject matter in case of human communication can vary a lot. But animals can only communicate about the aspects that can trigger stimuli in them.
Interchangeability: Humans do not have gender specific communication. The words that are used by male are the words that will be used by females also. But in the animal kingdom, the same may not be true. In case of some animals the male will use different ways of communication while the female communication can be different from the male one. 
Cultural transmission: Humans can acquire language culturally. In most cases humans will acquire different languages from different cultures and adapt to them. But the only way animals can communicate is inborn or biological. 
Arbitrariness: Since human language is symbolic through the use of phonemes and characters, thoughts can be preserved via a recorded medium. But animal communications can be preserved as record due to lack of any symbol or character. 
Biology: From a biological point of view, the human tongue and larynx has evolved in such a way that it can produce specific sounds consistently which will carry messages from one person to another person. But in Animal kingdom, the speech system is not developed to the same degree as humans and hence, they don’t have the flexibility and ability of humans to produce sounds such as humans do. 
Ambiguity: Another difference between human communication and animal communication is in the fact that, in case of human communication one word may carry different meanings depending upon the context while it is absent in various species of Animal kingdom. They use specific signs and those signs carry a single meaning only and hence there is no probability of ambiguity. 

Variety: Humans can combine the words, sounds in different ways and hence there are lots of varieties exists in human communication. The same thought or idea can be expressed in many different ways in human communication due to these varieties. But in Animals, no such variety exists and they express themselves in single ways only. 

**The mentalists questioned the principles of structuralism in mid 20th century. Discuss how this shift occurred in the study of language. Do you find any similarities between Chomsky’s ideas and that of Saussure? (500 words)**

Structuralism, in linguistics, any one of several schools of 20th century linguistics committed to the structuralist principle that a language is a self contained relational structure, the elements of which derive their existence and their value from their distributions and oppositions in texts or discourse. The principle was first stated clearly, for linguistics, by the Swiss scholar Saussure. It was further developed in somewhat different directions by the Prague school and other European movements. 
In the United States the term structuralism, or structural linguistics, has had much the same sense as it has had in Europe in relation to the work of Franz Boas and Edward Sapir and their followers. Nowadays though it is commonly used and in a narrow sense to refer to the so-called post - Bloomfieldian school of language analysis that follows the methods of Leonard Bloomfield developed after 1930. The study of sound systems (also known as phonology) and the study of word structure (also known as morphology) are their primary fields of interest. Little work on semantics has been done by structural linguists  because of their belief that the field is too difficult or elusive to describe.
Noam Chomsky has already established first language acquisition as an innate human ability. In his opinion language is part of the individual and therefore a result of natural human biology development. However, in Saussure's opinion, language is not only a part of a social construct but it is controlled by social conventions. According to Saussure, synchronic linguistics is the historical or evolutionary study of language which is dependent on social activity and change. According to him, diachronic changes occur within individual speaking patterns before being eventually accepted as part of the language. As he explained,”Speech always implies both an established system and an evolution; at every moment it is an existing institution and a product of the past.”
However according to Saussure, it is important to understand three of his terms. “speech”, “language” and “speaking” or “langage”, “langue” and “parole” respectively. Speech is physiologically and psychologically based and has both an individual and social side. According to Saussure, when the complex acoustic - vocal unit we know as “sound” combines with a thought, a new complex physiological - psychological unit is created that we call as “speech” He emphasizes that sound without thought is not “speech.”
Saussure points out that “speech” is individualized in that it is produced willfully and intellectually by a person, by way of “speaking.” Saussure also refers to “parole” as the “executie” side of speech - that which puts speech into practice. However, the way speech is used is determined through its society over time according to their language.  
Language, although significant, is only one part of speech. It consists of a collection of conventions that have been adopted by a community in order to structure and organize the mass of disorganized “speech” we hold in our minds. Thus, “language” is developed and keeps on developing so members of any community can use and understand their particular “language.”

**What are the different kinds of language variations? Explain by giving examples. (500 words)**

The language variation is an aspect of any language which makes it unique. There are many different ways linguists categorize different varieties of a language. Some definitions refer to word usage and rules, or merely to vocabulary, while others refer to the way language adapts culturally. All of these terms however, can cover variations in grammar, vocabulary and pronunciation. For example, the following are the varieties of language variations. 
Standard/polite/formal, Colloquial/informal, regional dialect, social dialect, lingua franca, pidgin, creole, vernacular, patois, lingo, jargon, slang etc. 
Standard: The standard or polite terms refers to the language that sticks to the rules and is represented as the proper form of the concerned language. In practice, this variation may not be used a lot but in case of formal writing, this variation is the one which is preferred in these circumstances. This is the form which is taught in most occasions even though other variations may also be taught depending upon the condition. 
Informal: In simple terms, it can be called the “spoken” language. This variation covers all others which do not fall into the variation of the standard one. It is called informal since in this variation, communication takes more precedence rather than rigidity of the rules. Many different versions of informal variation may exist since it isn’t rigid to the existing rules. 
Regional dialect: These are the varieties of language that emerge based on different variations that exist from one region to another one. In different countries, we see different regional dialects as we move from one region to another one. Even in the same region, different cities might follow different dialects. 
Social dialect: It emerges which does not take consideration about regional but it’s geared more towards a section of society. Hence, these variations exist in class or a specific culture rather than the whole region. 
Lingua Franca: A lingua franca is a common language that is spoken between two people who themselves speak different languages. The purpose of lingua franca is to close the gap between communication that exists between the two entities concerned as they speak different languages. This is very adaptable and hence they necessarily don’t follow the traditional rules of the language. For example, English is used as lingua franca across different countries since in different countries, people speak different languages and in order to communicate, English serves as the common language. 
Pidgin: It can be called a simple version of lingua franca. In the case of Pidgin, people try to form their own form of communications in order to establish the communications when both don't speak the same language. The difference between lingua franca and pidgin is that, in the case of pidgin, it takes a merger of two or more languages to form the common language via which those people, who speak different languages themselves, can communicate. 
Creole: it is an established form of pidgin where a language developed from communicating over two or more languages is taken up by the culture as a native language. The difference between Creole with pidgin or regional dialect is that Creole will have its own set of full range of functions along with rules.
Thus different types of variations exist in the English language. 



**The verb phrase is an important part of inflectional morphology. Discuss inflection through the verb phrase. (500 words)**

Inflectional morphology can be defined as the study of the modification of words to fit into grammatical contexts. It includes the study of processes including affixation and vowel change that distinguish word forms in certain grammatical categories. Inflectional morphology differs from derivational morphology or word formation in that, inflection deals with changes made to the existing words and derivation deals with the creation of new words. 
In the subject of inflectional morphology and derivational morphology, one essential component is morpheme which is pivotal in building up words. A morpheme is the smallest, meaningful, morphological unit in a language. This unit cannot be further divided or analyzed. There are two main types of morphemes out of which one is, inflectional morpheme and the other one is derivational morpheme. 
In inflectional morphology, a suffix is added to a word to assign a particular grammatical property to that word, such as its number, mood, tense or possession. But the most important that needs to be noticed here is that, an inflectional morphology can never change the grammatical category of a word. One can add inflectional morphology to a verb, noun, adjective or an adverb but under no circumstances, the inflectional morphology will change the grammatical category of the word that is taken under consideration. For example, adding ‘-ed’ to the verb dance creates the past tense of the verb i.e., ‘danced’ inflectional morphemes is producing different form of the same word instead of different words. Another example of such inflectional morphology can be “He has appeared on screen as an actor.” Here the verb phrase “has appeared” changes the grammatical form of the verb “appear” though it does not change the word. Hence, this is an example of inflectional morphology. In the sentence, “I will have been studying English for three years.” The verb phrase “will have been studying” is also doing the same purpose as we have seen in the previous example. In the above example, the verb phrase,” will have been studying” changes the grammatical form of the verb “study” but doesn’t change the word. 
 If the word changes into a whole new word after adding a suffix or prefix, then it becomes a derivational morphology. It can be defined as the study of the formation of new words that differ either in syntactic category or in meaning of their bases. Thus, a derivational morpheme is an affix we add to a word in order to create a new word or a new form of word. Moreover, a derivational morpheme can either change the meaning or the grammatical category of the word. For example, 
(Change in meaning):
Leaf -> Leaflet.
Pure -> Impure.
(Change in grammatical category):
Help (verb) -> Helper (noun)
Logic (noun) -> Logical (adjective)
This is where the biggest difference between inflectional morphology and derivational morphology comes in. While the inflectional morphemes create new forms of the same word, derivational morphemes create new words.
